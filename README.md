# State Flag

You will generate an HTML/CSS document that displays your state flag. If your state flag has a complicated design you may use an image. (For example, it would be fine to use an image for the palmetto tree in the South Carolina flag)
- You must use CSS to position any elements, as well as style the flag the appropriate colors.
- You may also use CSS transitions to move the flag on the page.
